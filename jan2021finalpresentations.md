# Alchemy JAN 2021 Cohort Final Presentations

Fourth and final projects made in a 10-day sprint, from concept through delivery, after week 24 in the program. These students have just finished more than 800 hours of our professional software development training. They've learned how to harness FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React, Redux, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, all while working on fully remote teams.

First one week sprint, from concept through delivery, after week 3 in the program.  Focus was vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, and teams built this working remotely.
