# Alchemy JAN 2021 Cohort Final Presentations

Fourth and final projects made in a 10-day sprint, from concept through delivery, after week 24 in the program. These students have just finished more than 800 hours of our professional software development training. They've learned how to harness FullStack JavaScript capabilities using React, Redux, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, all while working on fully remote teams.

First one week sprint, from concept through delivery, after week 3 in the program.  Focus was vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, and teams built this working remotely.

Angle On is a full-stack application that allows filmmakers from underrepresented communities to request support through donations. We integrated OAuth to utilize Google's authentication process and to create a seamless login experience. We create our own cookie for additional control over session length and storage. Each user profile has its own registration, application, and dashboard. An AWS S3 bucket hosts our image URLs so they can be transferred and stored in our relational database. Built with React Hooks | NodeJS | Express | PostgreSQL | AWS S3 | Google OAuth | Material UI
