# Alchemy Code Final Projects - May 2020

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students are finishing our professional software development training. Following you will find their Final Projects which harnesses the use of React, Redux, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Firebase, D3, Stripe and more. These projects were built in a one week sprint, remotely.

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.  

## Below is an overview of the apps presented and links to their sites and video of their presentations. Links to the LinkedIn profile each student is also included.

## PDX Secret Menu :: [Jenna Goldman](http://jennagoldman.com/), [Hannah Riley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-m-riley/), [Josh Ford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thisisjoshford/), & [Chris Ficht](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisficht/)

PDX Secret Menu is here to help both hungry Portland foodies and restaurant owners during these strange times! As local restaurants are currently unable to open for dine-in service, many owners are re-evaluating their business models and beginning to offer new formats of take-out options. PDX Secret Menu allows restaurants to sign up and register their businesses, populate current offerings, and create polls to find out what foodies are interested in seeing from them in the future. Foodies are also able to sign up, vote on polls, and purchase live offerings for scheduled pickup from their favorite restaurants.
Tech used: React with Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, integrations with Google Maps and Stripe.
