# Alchemy Code Final Projects - November 2020

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students are finishing our professional software development training. They are the second group to start with us remotely, and have learned to code, collaborate and be incredible teammates working from their homes. Following you will find their Final Projects which harnesses the use of React, Redux, PostreSQL, NodeJS, and Express, which were learned in our program, but also harnessed Python, tenserflow and Socket.io as well. These projects were built in a one week sprint, remotely.

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. We continue to be an on-line and live training program taught by experienced senior software developers and through this, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve the economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.
