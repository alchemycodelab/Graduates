# Alchemy Code Lab Mid-Career Track BackEnd Projects - April 2020

Welcome to [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com)! 

These students are 7 weeks from finishing our professional software development training. Following you will find their BackEnd Projects which harnesses the use of MongoDB, NodeJS and Express. These projects were built in a one week sprint, remotely. The first time Alchemy students have ever done so this way. 

Our emphasis on process, regular testing and immersive lab sessions allow our grads to understand how their coding works and why it does what it does. As the only engineering education in town that serves Portland and Portland only, combined with in-person training by experienced senior software developers, our grads are real contributors. We stay on top of the most used technologies and aim for our grads to evolve Portland's economy and community through the companies they go to work for. [Here is an overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVKZ4wzOLJn5OeIE-94riRoJGLpwLRG1SuBdGY7sedg/edit?usp=sharing) of their syllabus through our Career Track training.

## Poetica-Technica On Twitter [@PoeticaTechnica](https://twitter.com/PoeticaTechnica) :: [Nathan Martel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmartel/) & [Dorje Kirsten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorjekirsten/)

Tabula-Rasa is the back end of the Poegram front end site, it is  written by Nathan Martel, Dorje Kirsten and Erin. It uses the Poetry DB database to construct single line random poems from a chosen author or a completely random line. This line of poetry is then dropped onto an image that is randomly generated to create a Poegram.

While we engaged in a project of creating code that could present this experience to you, it was our sincere wish that we were also creating a tool for reflection, appreciation, contemplation, writing prompts, or even casual divination. This is what a poegram is. A tabula-rasa, so to speak, for you to experience, generate, and share with the world.
